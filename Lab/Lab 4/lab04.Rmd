## 2. Data Transformation and Visualization

This part of the lab follows Ch. 5 from https://r4ds.had.co.nz/.  For full details and explanations of functions, please see this book, *R for Data Science*. We will only work with the code portions here. We will cover ``dplyr`` and ``ggplot2``.

The dataset of interest will be ``nycflights13``, which contains information about all 336,776 flights that departed from NYC in 2013.  

First, in the console, install the packages ``nycflights13`` and ``tidyverse``.


```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("nycflights13")
library("tidyverse")
head(flights)
```

The ``flights`` data is stored as a **tibble**, which is a dataframe with some nice properties that work well in the ``tidyverse`` packages. Under each column name, there is information about the data type of each variable.  The data types for this data include:

- ``int``: integer
- ``dbl``: double precision, real number
- ``chr``: character vectors or strings
- ``dttm``: date-time


We are going to focus on 5 important ``dplyr`` functions that can be used to manipulate and subset data. These functions are:

1. ``filter()``: pick observations by their values (works on rows)
2. ``arrange()``: reorder the rows of a dataframe or tibble
3. ``select()``: pick variables by their names (works on columns)
4. ``mutate()``: create new variables with functions of existing variables
5. ``summarise()``:  create summary values by collpasing many values

Another useful function to know is ``group_by()``.  Instead of operating on the entire dataframe, ``group_by()`` changes the function so that it only works on a group-by-group basis.

For all of these functions, the syntax is as follows:

- 1st Argument: Data Frame
- Following Argument(s): describe what to do with the dataframe, use variable names without quotations here
- Result: new data frame

### filter() 

This function can be used to subset observations, based on their values (i.e. selecting by row).  Below is code to select all flights on January 1st:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```

``dplyr`` never modifies the input, so if we want to have a new data frame to save the result, we need to use the assignment operator to assign the filtered dataframe to a new name:

```{r}
jan1 <- filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1)
```




Suppose we want to select all rows for flights that left early.  How would we use the ``filter()`` function to do this?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 0)

```

Q: Is the above output the same as ``filter(flights, dep_delay < 0)``? Check.

When filtering, we need to use comparison operators to do so.  What are the symbols for the 6 primary comparison operators in ``R`` and what does each do?

```{r}
# >
# >=
# <
# <=
# !=
# ==
```

Be careful with floating point numbers when testing for equality!

```{r}
sqrt(2) ^ 2 == 2
```

```{r}
1 / 49 * 49 == 1
```


Why are these results not as expected?
```{r}
## Finite precision for computers
```

When we want to test equality with floating point numbers, we can use the ``near()`` function instead:

```{r}
near(sqrt(2) ^ 2,  2)

near(1 / 49 * 49, 1)
```

Boolean operators can be used to use multiple arguments. The Boolean operator for *and* is ``&``, for *or* is ``|`` and for *not* is ``!``.  


One common logical operation is exclusive or, ``XOR``. Visually, what does this logical operation look like for a venn diagram with variables ``x`` and ``y``?

```{r}
## XOR is x or y but not both, middle of venn diagram is only thing not shaded
```


This code finds all flights that departed in November or December:


```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
```


How would we select all flights that had an arrival delay of less than 10 minutes and occurred in September?

```{r}
flights %>% filter(arr_delay < 10 & month == 1)
```

Another really useful comparison function is ``%in%``.  For example, ``x %in% y`` selects every row where ``x`` is one of the values in ``y``.  For example, the two following lines of code are equivalent:

```{r}
filter(flights, month == 11 | month == 12)
filter(flights, month %in% c(11, 12))
```

De Morgan's law can be used for complicated expressions.  What is De Morgan's Law (from probability) and how would we write it in terms of R code?

```{r}
# !(x & y) same as !x | !y
# !(x | y) same as !x & !y
```


We can use De Morgan's law to select flights that weren't delayed (on arrival or departure) by more than two hours:

```{r}
filter(flights, !(arr_delay > 120 | dep_delay > 120))
filter(flights, arr_delay <= 120, dep_delay <= 120)
```


Most real life data includes missing values.  What are some possible reasons that data could be missing and what might the implications be for later modeling?


Missing values are represented as ``NA`` in ``R``. ``NA`` values are "contagious", so almost any operation involving an ``NA`` will also be ``NA``.


```{r}
NA > 5
10 == NA
NA + 10
NA / 2
```


What do you expect the result to be for the following code:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
NA == NA
```

```{r}
NA == NA
```

We can use the ``is.na()`` function to determine if a value is missing or is ``NA``.

The ``filter()`` function only includes rows that are ``TRUE``, ``FALSE`` and ``NA`` rows are excluded.

### arrange()

``arrange()`` changes the order of rows instead of selecting them.  

```{r}
arrange(flights, year, month, day)
```

The ``desc()`` function can be used to re-order by a specific column in descending order:

```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay))
```

Missing values are always sorted to the end.

```{r}
df <- tibble(x = c(5, 2, NA))
arrange(df, x)
arrange(df, desc(x))
```


### select()

The ``select()`` function can be used to select columns. This is especially useful when we don't want to include all variables in our analysis. 

We can select columns by name:

```{r}
select(flights, year, month, day)
```

or within a range:

```{r}
select(flights, year:day)
```

We can also select all columns except some specific ones:

```{r}
select(flights, -(year:day))
```

Here are some useful helper functions to use with ``select()``:

- ``starts_with("abc")``
- ``ends_with("xyz")``
- ``contains("ijk")``
- ``matches("(.)\\1")`` - selects variables based on a regular expression, this regular expression matches variables that contain repeated characters
- ``num_range("x", 1:3)``- matches ``x1``, ``x2``, and ``x3``


### mutate()

It is often really useful to add new columns to the data that are functions of existing columns and the ``mutate()`` function can be used for this. ``mutate()`` always adds new columns to the end of the data frame.

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)

mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

If you only want to keep the new variables, use ``transmute()``:

```{r}
transmute(flights,
  gain = dep_delay - arr_delay,
  hours = air_time / 60,
  gain_per_hour = gain / hours
)
```


The main requirement for functions that can be used with ``mutate()`` is that the function is vectorized. This means that the function has to take a vector of values as input and return a vector with the same number of values as an output.

Some examples are:
- arithmetic operators: ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``^``
- logs: ``log()``, ``log2()``, ``log10()``
- cummulative and rolling aggregates:  ``cumsum()``, ``cumprod()``, ``cummin()``, ``cummax()`` and ``cummean()``

```{r}
x <- 1:10
cumsum(x)
cummean(x)
```

- logical comparisons


How would we add a column to the ``flights`` tibble that is the total delay?

```{r}
flights %>% mutate(total_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay)
```

### summarise()

The ``summarise()`` function collapses a data frame into a single row.

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

It is more useful to pair ``summarise()`` with the ``group_by()`` function.  

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(flights, year, month, day)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


We can use pipes to chain together multiple functions.  What does the following code do step by step?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```

```{r}
delays <- flights %>% 
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
    delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  filter(count > 20, dest != "HNL")
```


The ``na.rm = TRUE`` argument drops all rows with ``NA`` values from the computation when we use ``group_by()``.

``count()``, ``mean()`` and ``median()`` are some useful arguments to the ``group_by()`` function.


```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## 3. Visualization with ggplot

Check out Ch.3 of https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html for some great discussion about ``ggplot`` and the grammar of graphics. For this part of the lab we will build on our data subsetting skills to create some nice plots using ``ggplot``.


We'll walk through a few example plots:


```{r}

ggplot(flights, aes(x = dep_delay, y = arr_delay, col = factor(month))) +
  geom_point()

```


```{r}

ggplot(flights, aes(x = dep_delay)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_grid(~factor(month))

```


1. Select all of the flights that occur within the first 10 days of each month.  Then, create a scatter plot using two of the numeric/continuous variables in the ``flights`` data set.  Color your plot points by the day of the month.

```{r}


```


2. Make a histogram of the scheduled departure time for the ``flights`` data. Change the label for the x-axis to be "Scheduled Departure Time" (hint look at ``?labs()``).  Add a title to your plot.

```{r}


```


## 3. Model Diagnostics

Randomly subset the ``flights`` data to only include 5000 rows.

```{r}


```


Using the ``lm()`` function, build a regression model trying to predict the ``arr_delay`` for the ``flights`` data.  Use the following variables as predictors:
``month``, ``day``, ``dep_time``, ``arr_time``, ``air_time`` and ``distance``.

```{r}



```

Without running any additional code, how does the model fit look?  Are there any variables that we can drop from the model?


Let's look at some model diagnostics, using the ``plot()`` function on our ``lm`` object.  What conclusions should we draw from the various diagnostic plots?

```{r}



```

What is your conclusion about this regression model and why?  How might we improve our model fit?
